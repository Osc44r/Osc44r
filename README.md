# Hello, I'm Oskar! 👋

## Cloud Engineer & Full Stack Developer

I'm a versatile engineer specializing in scalable cloud infrastructure, automation, and full stack development. My experience spans backend optimization, frontend integration, and DevOps, where I apply tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and FastAPI to build resilient systems. I’m passionate about leveraging cloud technologies to streamline complex processes, improve uptime, and drive efficiency in tech projects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, RESTful APIs, Redis, MongoDB, RabbitMQ
- **Frontend**: Vue.js, TypeScript
- **Automation & Microservices**: CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Microservices Architecture, Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)

## 🌱 What I'm Focused On
- Innovating with cloud-based solutions and “Everything as Code” for maintainable infrastructure.
- Enhancing full stack projects with real-time data handling and interactive dashboards.
- Currently working on [Express-Load.com](https://express-load.com), a SaaS API Gateway for Steam Inventory, where I’ve built a scalable backend and frontend system to handle high-volume requests and monitor data insights.

## 📦 My Projects
While I often work on confidential, high-impact tools, you can see my public contributions and some of my notable work like Express-Load.com, where I implemented automated CI/CD, secure API integrations, and a Vue.js-based analytics dashboard.
